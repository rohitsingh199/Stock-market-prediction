A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock
Stock Market Prediction and forecasing using Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)


Steps for prediction which i'm using:
1.We will collect the Stock data----apple(APPL)
2.Preprocess the Data-Train and Test.
3.Create An Stacked LSTM model.
4.predict the test data and plot the output.
5.predict the future 30 days and plot the output.
